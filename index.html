  <!-- React came up  with an idea to use HTML & CSS inside the JS -->
  <!-- Below is the core REACT -->
  <script type="module" src="./App.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- 
Note: In most of the time its  doesn't matter how big your file is there is only one root and one render method.
Root is the place where the react runs. We say whatever react we want to render we just render inside this root element
